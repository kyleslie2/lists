## Food and Drink 	
### Coffee and alcohol are always fun! And no clutter!

Coffee:
 - Whole beans (not ground)
 - Something I haven't tried before
 
 Alcohol (Help us _slowly_ stock our liquor cabinet!):
  - Any nice bottle of liquor we probably don't have (Hint: we don't have much haha)
  - Fun beer I might not have tried (Note: any type is fine *except sour beer*)
  - Wine: Always fun to try a new bottle together!
  
 Hotsauce (always like trying new, tasty hot-sauces):
 - *Tasty > painful!* Interesting flavours and medium heat is more enjoyable than pure pain!
 - Citrusy, fruity sauces with medium - high heat are fun
 
 Restaurants:
  - Restaurant gift-cards for brunch spots or dinner places are fun! Alicia and I love to go out to eat!

## Bags 	
### I love really nice backpacks and messenger bags/ sachels but don't have the money for them. Although I am picky about what I like when it comes to the style and quality of the bag &#128523;

Criteria:
  - Comfortable strap
  - Sleek design
  - Functional size (not too big or too small (holds my laptop + lunch + some pens/notebook)
  - Neutral colours (no orange or pink please haha)
 
 Examples of brands I like:

  - [InCase](https://www.incase.com/products/bags)

## Tech
### Tech gadgets and accessories I would love to get but don't _need_
  - [Rasperry Pi 4](https://www.buyapi.ca/raspberry-pi-4-information/)
    * I already have a 3B, but you can never have enough raspberry pis and I know that I could find a really fun use for another!
  - External SSD
    * Can always use more storage! Especially as I improve and expand our media server + at home backups on the network
    * anything over 1TB (1000GB) and with usb3 or 3.1 is great!

## Stuff for Eugene 
### Eugene can never have enough toys or supplies and if Eugene is happy, I'm happy 

Toys:
  - Anything squeaky or ball-shaped is a win for him 
     - he plays with them in the apartment, not outside
     - he likes fake-chasing it around the apartment and then sitting there squeaking it over and over, pretending he's killing bunnies...
  - Anything squirrel-like
  - Ideally somewhat durable
  - He enjoys chew-toys like the antler we bought him

Treats:
  - All treats are good  

Misc:
  - Clothing (indoor or outdoor), petsmart/ dog store gift-cards
